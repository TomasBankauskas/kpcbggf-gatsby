David is focused on software and services investments applicable to the energy and industrials markets. He is currently on the boards of Element Analytics and Choose Energy. Past investments include OSIsoft (shares acquired by SoftBank), ServiceMax (acquired by GE), UpWind Solutions (acquired by Vestas), SilverSpring Networks (SSNI) and Opower (acquired by Oracle).

In 2014, David cofounded Element Analytics, an industrial software company that connects time series data to cloud-based analytics applications to enable greater worker safety, sustainability, and business profit. Prior to KPCB, David developed his principal investing expertise at Bain Capital Credit, a $20B structured finance unit of Bain Capital. There, David helped manage a traditional energy portfolio, which included exploration, production, refining, field services and specialty chemicals. His involvement in the firm’s consumer portfolio included investments in multinationals within the food, health and sustainable business sectors.
